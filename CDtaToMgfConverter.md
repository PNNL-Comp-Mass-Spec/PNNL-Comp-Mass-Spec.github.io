# __<span style="color:#D57500">Concatenated DTA to Mascot Generic File (MGF) File Converter</span>__
Command-line utility that reads in a _Dta.txt file and creates the equivalent Mascot Generic Format (MGF) file. _Dta.txt files are large text files that contain numerous .Dta files, all concatenated together.

### Description
This format is in common use at PNNL (see this [Example _DTA.txt file](CDtaTextFileSplitter)). The MGF file format is a common text file format for listing peak lists of mass spectrometry data (lists of mass and intensity pairs), generally from MS/MS spectra.
