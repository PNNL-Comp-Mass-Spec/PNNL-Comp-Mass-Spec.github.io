# __<span style="color:#D57500">VIBE: Visual Integration for Bayesian Evaluation</span>__
The Visual Integration for Bayesian Evaluation (VIBE) software is a visualization tool that allows the user to observe classification accuracies at the class level and evaluate classification accuracies on any subset of available data types based on the posterior probability models defined for the individual and integrated data.

### Description
This software helps you integrate data from various high-throughput proteomics and metabolomics technologies using a Bayesian approach to integration that uses posterior probabilities to assign class memberships to samples using individual and multiple data sources; these probabilities are based on lower-level likelihood functions derived from standard statistical learning algorithms.
