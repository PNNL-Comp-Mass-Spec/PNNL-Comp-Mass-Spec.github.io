# __<span style="color:#D57500">MZRefinery</span>__
MZRefinery is a software tool for correcting systematic mass error biases in mass spectrometry data files. The software uses confident peptide spectrum matches from MSGF+ to evaluate three different calibration methods, then chooses the optimal transform function to remove systematic bias, typically resulting in a mass measurement error histogram centered at 0â€‰ppm. MzRefinery is part of the ProteoWizard package (in the msconvert.exe tool) and it thus can read and write a wide variety of file formats.

Download ProteoWizard from [http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/downloads.shtml](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/downloads.shtml)

See below for a command line utility for generating plots of the mass measurement errors before and after correction.

#### Software Instructions
The following is a typical workflow for using mzRefinery

1. Create a centroided .mzML file
  * `MSConvert.exe C:\WorkDir\DatasetName_2016-09-28.raw --filter "peakPicking true 1-" --mzML --32  -o C:\WorkDir`

2. Search the .mzML file using MSGF+ and a fully tryptic search and no dynamic mods (do include alkylation of cysteine if applicable):
  * `java.exe  -Xmx1500M -jar MSGFPlus.jar -s DatasetName_2016-09-28.mzML -o DatasetName_2016-09-28_msgfplus.mzid -d C:\FASTA\ID_003456_9B916A8B.fasta  -t 50ppm -m 0 -inst 3 -e 1 -ti -1,2 -ntt 2 -tda 1 -minLength 6 -maxLength 50 -n 1 -thread 7 -mod MSGFDB_Mods.txt -minNumPeaks 5 -addFeatures 1`

3. Run mzRefinery
  * `msconvert.exe C:\WorkDir\DatasetName_2016-09-28.mzML --outfile DatasetName_2016-09-28_FIXED.mzML --filter "mzRefiner C:\WorkDir\DatasetName_2016-09-28_msgfplus.mzid thresholdValue=-1e-10 thresholdStep=10 maxSteps=2" --32 --mzML`

4. Visualize the results from MzRefinery:
  * `PPMErrorCharter.exe C:\WorkDir\DatasetName_2016-09-28_msgfplus.mzid 1E-10`

5. Run MSGF+ again, this time using your longer search, for example partially tryptic or non-tryptic, plus any dynamic mods.
  * `java.exe  -Xmx4000M -jar MSGFPlus.jar -s DatasetName_2016-09-28.mzML -o DatasetName_2016-09-28_msgfplus.mzid -d C:\FASTA\ID_003456_9B916A8B.fasta  -t 10ppm -m 0 -inst 3 -e 1 -ti -1,1 -ntt 1 -tda 1 -minLength 6 -maxLength 50 -minCharge 2 -maxCharge 5 -n 1 -thread 8 -mod MSGFDB_Mods.txt -minNumPeaks 5 -addFeatures 1`
  * `java.exe  -Xmx2000M -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -cp MSGFPlus.jar edu.ucsd.msjava.ui.MzIDToTsv -i C:\WorkDir\DatasetName_2016-09-28_msgfplus.mzid -o C:\WorkDir\DatasetName_2016-09-28_msgfdb.tsv -showQValue 1 -showDecoy 1 -unroll 1`
